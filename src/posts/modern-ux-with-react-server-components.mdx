Earlier this week, Facebook's React revealed [Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html), which allow you to selectively move components to the back-end, aiming to improve bundle size and initial responsiveness, creating a tidy user experience.

This enables modern UX for server-driven applications, shifting the mental model of how modern applications are built.

## Rendering on the Client

Client components have not changed with this update.

However, you can explicitly render components on the client by appending `.client.js` to their respective files.
This tells React to not render them on the server, should they ever cross paths (more on this later).

```jsx
// Counter.client.js
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter({ initialCount = 0 }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  return <p onClick={() => setCount(count++)}>{count}</p>;
}
```

## Rendering on the Server

As described by their name, server components render behind-the-scenes, on the back-end.

You can indicate server components to React by appending their files with `.server.js`.
This tells React that these components should render on the server to later serialize to the client.

A practical application of server components is rendering heavy dependencies and components on the server.
This removes the burden on bundle size and initial paint time, improving responsiveness on the client.

```jsx
// Won't appear in bundle
import { useHeavyMethod } from 'heavyDependency';

function ServerComponent() {
  const data = useHeavyMethod();

  return <p>{data}</p>;
}
```

## Code-Splitting on the Server

Another practical application of server components replaces the old code-splitting model.

It's a good practice to break down your bundle into smaller bundles to lazily serve to the client as needed.
Prior to server-components, this would be accomplished with the `React.lazy` method, creating breakpoints to be served often when routing.

```jsx
// Client-side code-splitting by lazily-loading
import { lazy } from 'react';

const DefaultComponent = lazy(() => import('./DefaultComponent.js'));
const AlternateComponent = lazy(() => import('./AlternateComponent.js'));

function ClientComponent({ alternate }) {
  if (alternate) return <AlternateComponent />;

  return <DefaultComponent />;
}
```

Lazily loading requires splitting imports with dynamic imports and leaves a nasty impression on initial interaction, tainting user experience.

Server components solve this by treating all imports as possible code-splitting points, enabling the developer to choose the order of which components are used.
This allows the client to fetch and use components much earlier than traditional methods.

```jsx
// Server-side code-splitting by default
import DefaultComponent from './DefaultComponent.client.js';
import AlternateComponent from './AlternateComponent.client.js';

function ServerComponent({ alternate }) {
  if (alternate) return <AlternateComponent />;

  return <DefaultComponent />;
}
```

## Caveats

However, server components do not replace server-side rendering (SSR) and have some caveats of their own:

- Server components cannot render interactive components, forgoing hooks and events, and browser APIs. This leaves the burden of interaction to the client.
- Server components cannot pass props that cannot serialize over a network such as JSON. This means that functions and other complex data cannot transfer from the server to the client.

## Mixing it Up

Server components cannot take advantage of functional props or advanced state, leaving that to the client.
However, you can still use client components with server components to add back this interaction â€” they just won't render on the server.

```jsx
// Counter.server.js
import { useHeavyMethod } from 'heavyDependency';
import ClientCounter from './Counter.client.js';

function ServerComponent() {
  const initialCount = useHeavyMethod();

  return (
    <div className="counter-wrapper">
      <p>Initial Count: {initialCount}</p>
      <ClientCounter initialCount={initialCount} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

One thing to note here is that you can import and use client components within server components, but you cannot do the same with server components inside client components.

You can still pass server components as children to client components, but only within the scope of a server component.

## Conclusion

React server components empower developers to create lighter and tidier experiences by moving components off of the front-end runtime.
This completely changes the way that we work across front and back ends, treating them as one.

I am excited to see where this goes as Facebook continue research and development on this feature.
