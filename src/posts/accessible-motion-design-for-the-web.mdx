Motion design is a critical component of user experience, but not all enjoy animations equally.

It is estimated that up to 35% of adults 40+ in the US have suffered from some form of vestibular dysfunction [(source)](https://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder).
For these people, motion can trigger physical symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and malaise.

Operating systems offer a solution to this: users can opt-out of animations. The setting is meant primarily for the operating system, but websites and web applications can take advantage of it.

For a few years now, various operating systems have been letting users opt-out of animations, typically within accessibility settings:

When animations are disabled, all motion is reduced across the operating system.
This setting is exposed to our browsers using a media query, `prefers-reduced-motion`.
This way, websites can read and respect the same settings to disable animations.

## CSS Implementation

Animations can be disabled in CSS using a media query:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
    transition-duration: 0s !important;
    transition-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

By default, `no-preference` is the default value for those who opt-in animations and `reduce` for those who opt-out.

Although animations go from animated to still this way, a better mindset is to start from a still experience and enable motion conditionally:

```css
.example {
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
}

.example:hover {
  transform: translate3d(20px, 0, 0);
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .example {
    transition: transform: 200ms!important;
  }
}
```

By ensuring that the transition is set from within a media query, the animation is disabled by default for users on browsers that don't support this property.
Browsers ignore CSS inside unrecognized media queries, so this transition doesn't apply for them.

## JavaScript Hook

The media queries work great for CSS animations, but we'll need a solution for JavaScript animations and transitions.
Because this feature is implemented as a media query, it can be accessed the same way we access any media query values in JavaScript by using `window.matchMedia`:

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';

function usePrefersReducedMotion() {
  const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia?.('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
  const reduceMotion = useMemo(() => mediaQuery?.matches, [mediaQuery]);

  return reduceMotion;
}
```

This listener will fire when the user toggles the `reduce motion` settings in their operating system.

We want to listen for this event because we want to immediately halt animations if the user toggles this setting, even if the page has already loaded / the animation is in progress.

## JavaScript Implementation

Here's how we would use the hook with [three.js](https://threejs.org), a 3D rendering library that I frequently combine this with:

```jsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import {
  WebGLRenderer,
  PerspectiveCamera,
  Scene,
  BoxGeometry,
  MeshNormalMaterial,
  Mesh,
} from 'three';
import usePrefersReducedMotion from './hooks/prefersReducedMotion';

function AccessibleCube() {
  const canvas = useRef();
  const renderer = useRef();
  const camera = useRef();
  const scene = useRef();
  const mesh = useRef();
  const prefersReducedMotion = usePrefersReducedMotion();

  // Setup scene
  useEffect(() => {
    const { innerWidth, innerHeight } = window;

    // Initialize renderer to work over our canvas
    renderer.current = new WebGLRenderer({ canvas: canvas.current });
    renderer.current.setPixelRatio(2);
    renderer.current.setSize(innerWidth, innerHeight);

    // Initialize camera
    camera.current = new PerspectiveCamera(70, innerWidth / innerHeight, 0.01, 10);
    camera.current.position.z = 1;

    // Set the stage with a scene
    scene.current = new Scene();

    // Create a cube and its look and feel
    const geometry = new BoxGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 0.2);
    const material = new MeshNormalMaterial();
    mesh.current = new Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.current.add(mesh.current);

    // Cleanup after ourselves on unmount
    return () => {
      scene.current.remove(mesh.current);
      mesh.current.geometry.dispose();
      mesh.current.material.dispose();
      renderer.dispose();
      renderer.forceContextLoss();
      renderer = null;
    };
  }, []);

  // Handle animation
  useEffect(() => {
    // Only animate for no-preference
    if (!prefersReducedMotion) {
      renderer.current.setAnimationLoop(time => {
        mesh.current.rotation.x += time / 2000;
        mesh.current.rotation.y += time / 1000;

        renderer.current.render(scene.current, camera.current);
      });
    } else {
      renderer.current.render(scene.current, camera.current);
    }

    // Cleanup the animation loop, if present
    return () => {
      renderer.current.setAnimationLoop(null);
    };
  }, [prefersReducedMotion]);

  return <canvas aria-hidden ref={canvas} />;
}
```

We can control whether the scene is animated with the `usePrefersReducedMotion` hook.

This hook is plug-and-play, so you can connect this to any component or within other hooks.

## Conclusion

Not everyone experiences things the same way, and we need to be mindful of that in our work.

With the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and `usePrefersReducedMotion` React hook, we can create truly exciting, mindful experiences.
